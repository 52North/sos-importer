# Release Notes for SOS-Importer 0.5.0
## Features:
 *


## Changes:
 * Moved documentation to github, hence content of README.md and https://wiki.52north.org/bin/view/SensorWeb/SosImporter merged
 * Updated to latest 52N parent &rarr; javadoc and dependency plugin cause a lot of minor adjustments 

## Bugfixes:
 * #35: Could not parse ISO8601 timestamps with timezone "Z"
 * #36: Strategy "SweArrayObservationWithSplitExtension" doesn't work with TextObservations
 * #57: Feeder fails to read FoI positions
 * #58: Null Pointer Exception (NPE) when feeder tries to register a sensor
 * #62: Number of read lines not stored
 * #63: Cannot build importer when host in timezone MST (-07:00)
 * #66: Parsing Unix time fails

# Release Notes for SOS-Importer 0.4.0
## Features:
 * Rename *Core* module to *Wizard*
 * Support for SOS 2.0 incl. Binding definition
 * Start Screen offers button to see all dependency licenses
 * Support for sensors with multiple outputs
 * Introduced import strategies:
   * SingleObservation: Default strategy
   * SweArrayObservationWithSplitExtension:
        Reads hunksize# lines and imports each time series using an
        SWEArrayObservation in combination with the SplitExtension of the
        52North SOS implementation. Hence, this strategy works only in
        combination with 52North implementation. Other impl. might work, too,
        but not as expected. Hunksize and import strategy are both optional
        `<AdditionalMetadata><Metadata>` elements.
 * Support for date information extraction from file name using two new
   OPTIONAL attributes in element `<DataFile>`:
   * "regExDateInfoInFileName" for extracting date information from file names.
   * "dateInfoPattern" for parsing the date information into a java.util.Date.
 * Date information extraction from last modified date using two new OPTIONAL
   attributes:
   * "useDateFromLastModifiedDate" for enabling this feature
   * "lastModifiedDelta" for moving the date n days back (this attribute is
     OPTIONAL for this feature, too.)
 * Ignore lines with regular expressions feature:
   0..infinity `<IgnoreLineRegEx>` elements can be added to the `<DataFile>`
   element. <br />
   Each element will be used as regular expression and applied to each line of
   the data file before parsing.
 * Handling of data files containing several sample runs. A sample run contains
   additional metadata like its size (number of performed measurements) and a
   date.<br />
   The required attributes are:
   * "sampleStartRegEx":<br />
     the start of a new sample (MUST match the whole line).
   * "sampleDateOffset":<br />
     the offset of the line containing the date of the sample from the start line.
   * "sampleDateExtractionRegEx":<br />
      the regular expression to extract the date information from the line containing the date information of the current sample. The expression MUST result in ONE group. This group will be parsed to a `java.util.Date` using "sampleDatePattern" attribute.
   * "sampleDatePattern":<br />
     the pattern used to parse the date information of the current sample.
   * "sampleDataOffset":<br />
     the offset in lines from sample beginning till the first lines with data.
   * "sampleSizeOffset":<br />
     the offset in lines from sample beginning till the line containing the sample size in lines with data.
   * "sampleSizeRegEx":<br />
     the regular expression to extract the sample size. The regular expression MUST result in ONE group  which contains an integer value.
   * "sampleSizeDivisor":<br />
     defines a divisor that is applied to the sample size. Can be used in cases the sample size is not giving the number of samples but the time span of the sample. The divisor is used to calculate the number of lines in a sample. (OPTIONAL)
 * Setting of timeout buffer for the insertion of SweArrayObservations:
   With the attribute "insertSweArrayObservationTimeoutBuffer" of `<SosMetadata>` it is possible to define an additional timeout buffer for connect and socket timeout when using import strategy "SweArrayObservationWithSplitExtension". Scale is in milliseconds, e.g. 1000 => 1s more connect and socket timeout. The size of this value is related to the set-up of the SOS server, importer,
   and the HUNK_SIZE value. The current OX-F SimpleHttpClient implementation uses a default value of 5s,
   hence setting this to 25,000 results in 30s connection and socket timeout.
 * "CsvParserClass" add to CsvMetadata. The class that MUST be used for parsing
   the data file. The interface org.n52.sos.importer.feeder.CsvParser MUST be
   implemented. The class name MUST contain the fully qualified package name
   and a zero-argument constructor MUST be provided.
