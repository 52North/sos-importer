Release Notes for SOS-Importer 0.4.0
====================================
Features:
---------
 * Support for sensors with multiple outputs
 * Introduced import strategies:
   * SingleObservation: Default strategy 
   * SweArrayObservationWithSplitExtension: 
        Reads hunksize# lines and imports each time series using an 
        SWEArrayObservation in combination with the SplitExtension of the 
        52North SOS implementation. Hence, this strategy works only in 
        combination with 52North implementation. Other impl. might work, too,
        but not as expected. Hunksize and import strategy are both optional 
        <AdditionalMetadata><Metadata> elements.
 * Support for date information extraction from file name using two new 
   OPTIONAL attributes in element <DataFile>:
   * "regExDateInfoInFileName" for extracting date information from file names.
   * "dateInfoPattern" for parsing the date information into a java.util.Date.
 * Date information extraction from last modified date using two new OPTIONAL
   attributes:
   * "useDateFromLastModifiedDate" for enabling this feature
   * "lastModifiedDelta" for moving the date n days back (this attribute is 
     OPTIONAL for this feature, too.)
 * Ignore lines with regular expressions feature:
   0..infinity <IgnoreLineRegEx> elements can be added to the <DataFile> element.
   Each element will be used as regular expression and applied to each line of 
   the data file before parsing.
