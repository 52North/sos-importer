CSVFiles= \
Comma-Separated Values (CSV) files represent
tabular data in a textual format. An CSV file
could for example look like this:
Date, Sensor1, Sensor2
01.01.2011, 1.3, 1.4
02.01.2011, 2.5, 4.4
03.01.2011, 1.7, 2.3

ColumnSeparator=
Columns in a CSV file are delimited by a 
special character. For example ';' separates 
the columns in the following CSV file:
Date; Sensor1; Sensor2
01.01.2011; 1.3; 1.4
02.01.2011; 2.5; 4.4
03.01.2011; 1.7; 2.3
CommentIndicator=
Lines beginning with a comment character will
not be parsed. For example '#' indicates
comments in the following CSV file:
# This is a comment
Date, Sensor1, Sensor2
01.01.2011, 1.3, 1.4
02.01.2011, 2.5, 4.4
03.01.2011, 1.7, 2.3
TextQualifier=
Fields in a CSV file that contain a special character 
(e.g. the column separator or a newline) have to be
enclosed by a text qualifier. For example '"'
escapes special symbols in the following CSV file:
Nr, Observation
1, "New \n line"
2, "Separate , column"
3, "A ""quote"" within"
MeasuredValue=
A measured value is the result of a measurement or 
an observation. For example, '37.1' would be the measured
value of the temperature 37.1°C.
NumericValue=
Numeric values are decimal numbers like 2.3 or -52.0.
DecimalSeparator=
The decimal mark delimits the decimal places of a 
numeric value. For example ',' would be the decimal 
separator for the numeric value 1234,52133.
ThousandsSeparator=
For a better overview, numeric values are structured
with a thousands mark. For example '.'would be the 
thousands separator of the number 1.254.623.129 
meaning 1254623129.
Boolean=
Booleans are values like 'true' and 'false' or 
'1' and '0'.
Count=
Counts are positive natural numbers like 1 2 3.
Text=
Observations like 'good' or 'the sun is shining' 
can be classified as Text.
FeatureOfInterest=
A feature of interest is involved in making observations 
concerning a domain feature. Exemplary features of interests
are stations, transects, sections or specimen. [O&M]
ObservedProperty=
An observed property is a natural phenomenon, which may 
use one of a variety of scales including nominal, ordinal, 
ratio and interval. The term is used regardless of whether 
the value is due to an instrumental observation or a subjective 
assignment [SensorML]. 'Temperature', 'PM10', 'Soil type' or
'Weather condition' are all examples for observed properties.
UnitOfMeasurement=
A unit of measurement is a definite magnitude of a 
physical quantity, that is used as a standard for 
measurement of the same physical quantity. For example
'm' would be the unit of measurement of the length 10m.

Sensor=
A sensor is an entity capable of observing a phenomenon 
and returning an observed value. [SensorML] 'ThermometerXYZ'
and 'PM10SensorMünster123' would be examples of sensors.
