CSVFile=<html>\
Comma-Separated Values (CSV) files represent<br>\
tabular data in textual format. A CSV file could<br>\
have the following content:<br>\
<br>\
Date, Sensor1, Sensor2<br>\
01.01.2011, 1.3, 1.4<br>\
02.01.2011, 2.5, 4.4<br>\
03.01.2011, 1.7, 2.3<br>\
</html>
ColumnSeparator=<html>\
Columns in a CSV file are delimited by a <br>\
special character. For example, ; separates <br>\
the columns in the following CSV file:<br>\
<br>\
Date; Sensor1; Sensor2<br>\
01.01.2011; 1.3; 1.4<br>\
02.01.2011; 2.5; 4.4<br>\
03.01.2011; 1.7; 2.3<br>\
</html>
CommentIndicator=<html>\
Lines beginning with a comment character will<br>\
not be imported. For example, # indicates<br>\
comments in the following CSV file:<br>\
<br>\
Date, Sensor1, Sensor2<br>\
# This is a comment<br>\
01.01.2011, 1.3, 1.4<br>\
02.01.2011, 2.5, 4.4<br>\
03.01.2011, 1.7, 2.3<br>\
</html>
TextQualifier=<html>\
Fields in a CSV file that contain a special character <br>\
(e.g. a column separator or a new line) have to be<br>\
enclosed by a text qualifier. For example, "<br>\
escapes special symbols in the following CSV file:<br>\
<br>\
Nr, Observation<br>\
1, "New \n line"<br>\
2, "Separate , column"<br>\
3, "A ""quote"" in a text"<br>\
</html>
MeasuredValue=<html>\
A measured value is the result of a measurement or <br>\
an observation. For example, '37.1' would be the measured<br>\
value of the temperature 37.1°C.<br>\
</html>
NumericValue=<html>\
Numeric values are decimal numbers like 2.3 or -52.0.<br>\
</html>
DecimalSeparator=<html>\
The decimal mark delimits the decimal places of a <br>\
numeric value. For example ',' would be the decimal <br>\
separator for the numeric value 1234,52133.<br>\
</html>
Boolean=<html>\
Booleans are values like 'true' and 'false' or <br>\
'1' and '0'.<br>\
</html>
Count=<html>\
Counts are positive natural numbers like 1 2 3.<br>\
</html>
Text=<html>\
Observations like 'good' or 'the sun is shining' <br>\
can be classified as Text.<br>\
</html>
FeatureOfInterest=<html>\
A feature of interest is involved in making observations <br>\
concerning a domain feature. Exemplary features of interests<br>\
are stations, transects, sections or specimen. <br>\
</html>
ObservedProperty=<html>\
An observed property is a natural phenomenon, which may <br>\
use one of a variety of scales including nominal, ordinal, <br>\
ratio and interval. The term is used regardless of whether <br>\
the value is due to an instrumental observation or a subjective <br>\
assignment. 'Temperature', 'PM10', 'Soil type' or<br>\
'Weather condition' are examples for observed properties.<br>\
</html>
UnitOfMeasurement=<html>\
A unit of measurement is a definite magnitude of a <br>\
physical quantity, that is used as a standard for <br>\
measurement of the same physical quantity. For example<br>\
'm' would be the unit of measurement of the length 10m.<br>\
</html>
Sensor=<html>\
A sensor is an entity capable of observing a phenomenon <br>\
and returning an observed value. 'ThermometerXYZ'<br>\
and 'PM10SensorMünster123' are examples of sensors.<br>\
</html>
DateAndTimePatterns=<html>\
G - Era designator (e.g. AD)<br>\
y - Year (e.g. 1996; 96)<br>\
M - Month in year (e.g. July; Jul; 07)<br>\

W - Week in month (e.g. 2)<br>\
D - Day in year (e.g. 189)<br>\
d -	Day in month (e.g. 10)<br>\
F -	Day of week in month (e.g. 2)<br>\
E - Day in week (e.g. Tuesday; Tue)<br>\

Z - RFC 822 Time zone (e.g. -0800)<br>\
</html>
DateAndTime=<html>\
Date and time describe when a measurement was performed<br>\
or when a phenomenon was observed.<br>\
</html>
DateAndTimeGroups=<html>\
When date and time are split into different columns<br>\
(e.g. date in one, and time another column), they<br>\
have to be put in the same group to be later combined.<br>\
<br>\
For example:<br>\
Date, Time, Value<br>\
01.01.2011, 00:00:00, 4.3<br>\
02.01.2011, 01:00:00, 5.2<br>\
03.01.2011, 02:00:00, 6.5<br>\
</html>
Position=<html>\
The position indicates where a measurement took place. <br>\
In this application, the position is interpreted as the <br>\
location of the feature of interest. <br>\
</html>
PositionPatterns=<html>\
LAT - Latitude (e.g. -31.4°) or Northing (e.g. 3.531.233m)<br>\
LON - Longitude (e.g. 9.1) or Easting (e.g. 400.114m)<br>\
ALT - Height (e.g. 100m)<br>\
EPSG - EPGS-Code (e.g. 25832)<br>\
</html>
PositionGroups=<html>\
When positions are split into different columns<br>\
(e.g. latitude in one, and longitude in another column), <br>\
they have to be put in the same group to be later combined.<br>\
<br>\
For example:<br>\
Latitude, Longitude; Station<br>\
52.51°, 8.15°; Weatherstation1<br>\
52.62°, 8.11°; Weatherstation2<br>\
52.59°, 8.16°; Weatherstation3<br>\
</html>
Name=<html>\
This can be a human-readable name, term or ID.<br>\
</html>
URI=<html>\
The uniform resource identifier (URI) distinctively <br>\
identifies a source of information. A URI can either be a <br>\
URL (e.g. http://www.eo2heaven.org/) or a URN <br>\
(e.g. urn:ogc:def:phenomenon:OGC:1.0.30:Temperature).<br>\
</html>
SOS=<html>\
A Sensor Observation Service provides an API for <br>\
managing deployed sensors and retrieving sensor data <br>\
and specifically observation data. <br>\
</html>
EPSG=<html>\
The European Petroleum Survey Group (EPSG) has <br>\
established a system of unique identifiers <br>\
for spatial references systems. EPSG-Codes are<br>\
positive integers ranging from 0 to 32767.<br>\
</html>
ReferenceSystem=<html>\
This is the name of the spatial reference system<br>\
corresponding to the EPSG-Code on the right.<br>\
</html>
UTCOffset=<html>\
The UTC offset is the offset from the Coordinated<br>\
Universal Time (UTC). It is usually given in hours <br>\
and minutes (e.g. +06:30). In this application, <br>\
only hours ranging from -12 to 12 are available.<br>\
