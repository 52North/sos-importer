This directory contains dependencies which are not migrated to maven dependency
mechanism yet. It's subdirectoy structure contains a file based Maven repository.

To run a successful maven test/compile/package/... you first have to install the
libs into your local repository (normally located at ~/.m2). Then Maven will find
the libs on its path during upcoming builds. This installation is automaticall
done by installing the parent project, which references the file repository in
this directory.
